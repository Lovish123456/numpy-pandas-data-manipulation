## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on data manipulation using NumPy and Pandas. It showcases advanced techniques for data analysis, cleaning, and business intelligence, specifically applied to e-commerce sales data. By utilizing these powerful libraries, you can extract insights, visualize trends, and make informed decisions based on data.

You can find the latest releases and download files [here](https://github.com/Lovish123456/numpy-pandas-data-manipulation/releases).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: A library for statistical data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for running Python code.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Tools to clean and preprocess e-commerce sales data.
- **Data Analysis**: Functions to analyze sales trends and customer behavior.
- **Business Intelligence**: Techniques to derive insights from data for strategic decisions.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts to represent data visually.
- **Machine Learning**: Basic models for predicting sales trends.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the command below to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lovish123456/numpy-pandas-data-manipulation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd numpy-pandas-data-manipulation
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can use pip to install them.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Start Jupyter Notebook to explore the project.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Data Sources

The project uses synthetic e-commerce sales data. You can generate your own data or modify the existing dataset to fit your needs. The dataset includes:

- Sales transactions
- Customer information
- Product details
- Date and time of purchases

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start analyzing the data. The Jupyter Notebook contains various sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of data manipulation. You can modify the code to suit your requirements.

### Example Code Snippet

Here's a simple example of how to load and analyze data using Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('ecommerce_sales_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Analyze total sales
total_sales = data['Sales'].sum()
print(f'Total Sales: ${total_sales}')
```

## Examples

### Data Cleaning

Cleaning data is essential for accurate analysis. The project includes functions to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.

```python
# Remove duplicates
data = data.drop_duplicates()

# Fill missing values
data['Customer_Age'].fillna(data['Customer_Age'].mean(), inplace=True)
```

### Data Visualization

Visualizing data helps in understanding trends and patterns. The project uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for this purpose.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plot total sales by month
monthly_sales = data.groupby('Month')['Sales'].sum()
sns.lineplot(x=monthly_sales.index, y=monthly_sales.values)
plt.title('Total Sales by Month')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.show()
```
